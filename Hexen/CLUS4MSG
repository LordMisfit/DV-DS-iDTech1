With a sigh mixed of both relief but
also of exhaustion, you enter the portal
guarded by the 2nd Heresiarch...

Suddenly as you come out, you realize
you are now in a demi realm of its own,
unlike most of Cronos, and a realm very
reminescent of death itself.

You mutter a light curse of indignation
as you also sense a familar, though weak-
er version of Korax's energy aura. He's
very much here, but you also sense three
other fairly powerful auras, those of
beings once human, but no longer...

The three "grandmasters who ruled Cronos"
... Oh bloody wonderful. You remember the
names now: Zedek, Menelikir and Traductus.

Well, it's time to go visit ol' anteater-
face and give him a classic dosage of
justice for Cronos, Briscoletti-style.

Well, that's the plan, anyways... you
hope your powers are back up to snuff...
