Wondering just how in the world you
ended up in this situation, you
recognize the image of the 'demon'
back there as that of Korax, second
of the horrible "Serpent Riders",
of whom you and your friends on
Zendaria once faced off against as
a team.

Did you get sent back into the past
yet again? Is Korax behind this him-
self? Why were your powers completely
unset upon arriving here? Where IS
here exactly?

You realize that you must press on
to find out as you fall through the
realms with a feeling of dread...
