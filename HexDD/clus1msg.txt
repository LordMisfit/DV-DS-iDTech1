So once again, you had found yourself
stripped of the power you accquired
in your battles with Korax. 

Immediately upon entering this realm
you realized with shock where you were.

This is the realm of the Deathkings, a
realm once taken over in your own time
by the combined power of all three
Serpent Riders...

You wipe the sweat off your head to 
prepare for what lies ahead...

In the distance, a great castle seems 
to rend the sky above, and the stench 
of decay wafts from the violated 
graves of uncounted dead.

Not a pleasant sight, but one you'll
need to endure on your quest to get
out... Time to get moving...
