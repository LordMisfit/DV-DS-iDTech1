You suddenly receive a very disturbing 
vision...

A FOURTH being, one whom looks very diff-
erent from either Eidolon, Korax and 
D'Sparil.

A being seen standing ABOVE the three
Serpent Riders in not only power, but
one who potentially embodies the very
concept of CHAOS itself, the original
creator of the Chaos Sphere...

Erebus... the Agent of Chaos... He
still lived at this point in time, and
being that you and your friends never
met him in your own, you have to wonder
if he has managed to survive all this
time since...

Now you realize you must return home
and find out his status pronto...

But perhaps it won't be quite as easy
as you thought. The chaos sphere has
its' own plans for you still...
