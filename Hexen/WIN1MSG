With the fall of Korax and the three former
"grandmasters", you quickly rush into
the portal to escape the possible collapse
of his Dark Crucible.

However this portal unlike most of the
others actually feels almost outright ago-
nizing to move through, like your whole
body is bathed in mystical, ethereal
fire.

When you come to, you find yourself in an
omnious hallway, dark all about with only
a few torches and a bright, unnatural
source of light to mark the way.

Looking to the dias, you see something...
peculiar in the distance, and move forward
to inspect it.
