As you've passed through the Deathkings'
realm, you start to get a good idea of
why Korax, D'Sparil and Eidolon went to
lay claim to this realm in their revenge
offensive against the universe in the
present...

The souls of the damned inhabit this wor-
ld, and nothing fair or good has survived 
here for long. Not to mention your patie-
nce has greatly waned with all the inhabi-
tants of this realm...

Ahead of you lies the Dark Citadel its-
elf, the very same one the Serpent Riders
will eventually lay claim to in your own
time and then also fall in battle within...

Amongst the shadows of death inside, you
only wonder who the Deathkings of this 
timeline are like, before the Riders took 
their place...
