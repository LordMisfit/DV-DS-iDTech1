So, you had much 'fun' dealing with that
Heresiarch, the same species of demons from
which Pal'nekrian himself came from. Well
now you know what the unoriginal demon fool
based himself off of.

Moving past that, you now tumble forth again
through the aether, passing into a new part
of Cronos, or what you hope is still part of
Cronos. The "Castle of Grief", one of Korax's
grand bastions of terror, looms above you in
the distance.

You also sense the presense of yet ANOTHER
Heresiarch somewhere within, and something
tells you it's not going to be exactly the
same battle as the previous one, as if some-
thing particularly devious is waiting for
you...

Still, you can't help all this time but won-
der what in the universe brought you here
into all of this, and WHY...

Best to just keep moving on, and living...
that's obviously necessary too of course...
