With the demise of the Deathkings, you
realize this is what left the realm 
open to the coming of the slain souls 
of the three Serpent Riders.

However you've found yourself back in 
the hall of the Chaos Sphere, holding it 
in your trembling hands, almost as if 
the trip into the dead-realms was noth-
ing more than a mere dream.

It makes you wonder if Erebus himself 
had a hand in creating this horrible 
realm, and left it as a backup measure 
for his "children" if they were slain by 
some lucky "heroes" in combat...
