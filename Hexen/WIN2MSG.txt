You take a closer look at what you clearly
have identified as a white, ghostly orb,
and you give an audible gasp of horrified
realization...

THIS... this sphere, the "CHAOS SPHERE", the
source of not only KORAX'S power, but the
same that would be used by Eidolon later on
to conquer the world of Thyrion, sits in
wait, its power barely contained within
its global form.

You want to touch the sphere if only to
truly analyze the scope of it's power, but
you fear what will come of it, knowing to
touch it could unleash an even more chaotic
set of events than when you originally
found and touched your own sceptre over 10
years ago and brought on Sauron's attention.

Xenos however urges you to inspect the
sphere, believing it might be able to help
you escape back to your own time.

You reach out and grasp the sphere with
hesitiation...
