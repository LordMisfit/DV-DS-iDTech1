Tha dragon lich back there was a horrible
example of what kind of powers Korax must
have wielded at this particular point in
time.

Having trudged through the wastelands, you
were contacted by Xenos, who managed to
locate you and informing you that indeed,
you were sent into the past, to the world
of Cronos, of which Korax had conquered at
one time.

The same world Romulo claimed to have trav-
eled to in his little 'self-journey' after
that once 'incident' in your childhood.

You ask Xenos if he or Korax is responsible
for your situation. Xenos tells you that he
had nothing to do with this, but that he
also cannot see this as something Korax, at
least not the one of this time, can do.

Now at the towers of a grand seminary, you
can only wonder what horrors Korax has wait-
ing for you from here on...
