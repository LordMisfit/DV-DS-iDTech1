Your vision suddenly becomes a blinding
white, and the next thing you know, you
find yourself in your bedroom back home,
in your own time, your original powers
restored, thankfully...

In your hands lies the Chaos Sphere, and
you quickly realize, it's time to figure
out where Erebus might be hiding. Then
again, perhaps he's not hiding, he might
even have been destroyed before now, but
you cannot rely on that kind of lucky
break...

Soon, you must prepare to break the final
grip of the Serpent Riders and their
chaotic master from this reality forever.

At least that's the plan...
