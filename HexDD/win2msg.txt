Looking down at the Chaos Sphere in
your hands, you see it's energies and
pulsations have calmed down, and have
tapered off submissively, almost as if
in defeating the DeathKings, you have
claimed the Sphere as your own, and it
has shown acceptance of your posSess-
ion...

However you realize to take the Sphere
now could endanger the timeline you are
in even more. On the other hand, perhaps
you'll need the Sphere to figure out how
to track down Erebus in your own time...

Xenolatias suggests you take it with you
for now, now concerned personally about
your discovery of Erebus. You have only
heard him this no-nonsense and serious
a few times in your life since you first
met him...
